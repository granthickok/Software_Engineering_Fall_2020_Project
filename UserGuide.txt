/// USER GUIDE FOR ONLINE SHOPPING PORTAL ///

/// DRIVER AND CUSTOMER PORTALS NOT INCLUDED (in development) ///

Welcome user!
Lets get started with all the functions available to manager users.
In the main menu you will see 3 applications:

-Inventory Management-
    In this menu, you will see an empty table to the left of the
    screen. This will populate with info on inventory items in our
    registry. To see all items, simply click the "View All Items"
    button. You will now see the table populated with grocery items.

    To sort items, simply click the header of the column you want to
    sort, and the table will filter automatically. Click once for
    increasing order and twice for decreasing order. Clicking again
    will remove the sort. You can also sort items before populating
    the table. Just click the drop down menu by the "View All Items"
    button before clicking it.

    To search items by name or category, just enter the whole named
    value, or part of the value. Clicking the "Search Items" button
    will filter to those keywords. To search by quantity or price,
    enter an integer value into either field. "Search Items" will
    now filter the table to show values less than or equal to the
    user input. Adding a "+" before the value will show items
    greater than or equal to your input.

    You can also update product information here! Click the "Update"
    button under the table to open a text file of recorded info for
    products. BE VERY CAREFUL TO NOT CORRUPT THE FILE WITH BAD INPUT
    SEE SUPERVISOR FOR VALID UPDATE PROCEDURE.

-View and Manage Orders-
    Like the previous menu, you will see an empty table to the left
    of the screen. This will populate with info on inventory orders
    in our registry. To see all items, simply click the "View All
    Items" button. You will now see the table populated with
    inventory orders.

    To sort items, simply click the header of the column you want to
    sort, and the table will filter automatically. Click once for
    increasing order and twice for decreasing order. Clicking again
    will remove the sort.

    To search items by user or item, just enter the whole named
    value, or part of the value. Clicking the "Search Items" button
    will filter to those keywords. To search by quantity or price,
    enter an integer value into either field. "Search Items" will
    now filter the table to show values less than or equal to the
    user input. Adding a "+" before the value will show items
    greater than or equal to your input.

    You can also update product information here! Click the "Update"
    button under the table to open a text file of recorded info for
    products. BE VERY CAREFUL TO NOT CORRUPT THE FILE WITH BAD INPUT
    SEE SUPERVISOR FOR VALID UPDATE PROCEDURE. Ordering new items is
    also possible. Just add a valid line that contains your user
    information and item info. Refer to the previous warning.

-Notifications-
    This button will not redirect you to another menu, instead, it
    will open a new window with a table that contains items that are
    either low in stock or will expire soon.
